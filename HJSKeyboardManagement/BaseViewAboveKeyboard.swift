/**
:brief: A common base class for managing keyboard view changes.

:description:
Regardless of what action wants to be taken there is a fair amount of common code around moving views when the
keyboard appears. This common base class takes a view that is to be manipulated and watches the keyboard notification.
It tracks where the keyboard is in the view's local space and calls an overridable function to do something in
response.

This also manages the issue where the keyboardWilChangeFrame notification is supposed to store a
UIViewAnimationCurve constant but sometimes returns 7, which is really a bitmask of a few bits in
UIViewAnimationOptions. It checks if the value really is a valid UIViewAnimationCurve. If it isn't, but the
rawValue was 7 then it will go ahead and log a debug message to that effect and set the curveType to .EaseInEaseOut.
If the value was some *OTHER* thing it logs a critical message about having an unknown value and sets the curveType
to .EaseInEaseOut anyway. So curveType will ALWAYS be legal, even if the behavior of this is changed in the future.

Child classes need to override update() to do whatever adjustments they provide. They should also override
zeroAdjustments which will be called when the adjustment needs to be entirely removed. They can optionally override
hasInvalidState which is used to determine whether everything is valid enough to run update, but if they override that
they should call super as well.
