/**
:brief: Adjusts the center of a view to keep a child view above the keyboard.

Takes a a view to adjust as the keyboard needs, and then you can specify which child view needs to be right above the 
top of the keyboard. The widget will process the keyboard notifications and do the right tricks. You can change
targetView and the adjustment will update as needed. It also handles ongoing tweaks like turning the iOS 8 predictive
text bar on/off can change the amount of adjustment that is needed.

Lastly, it manages the issue where the keyboardWilChangeFrame notification is supposed to store a
UIViewAnimationCurve constant but sometimes returns 7, which is really a bitmask of a few bits in
UIViewAnimationOptions. It checks if the value really is a valid UIViewAnimationCurve. If it isn't, but the
rawValue was 7 then it will go ahead and log a debug message to that effect and set the curveType to .EaseInEaseOut.
If the value was some *OTHER* thing it logs a critical message about having an unknown value and sets the curveType
to .EaseInEaseOut anyway. So curveType will ALWAYS be legal, even if the behavior of this is changed in the future.

:warning: 
This class is designed for a simple UIView that just needs to be adjusted in parent space. If you have a
UIScrollView than you probably also want to take contentOffset into account which this class does not.

Objective C usage (called from a UIViewController):

:code:
KeepViewAboveKeyboard * _keyboardWatcher = [[KeepViewAboveKeyboard alloc] initWithView:self.view];
_keyboardWatcher.targetView = _detailField;

	/// the offset. You can set this from textFieldDidBeginEditing to make sure the correct field is above the keyboard.
