HJSDebug is a logger that supports logging levels, automatic rotation of logs based on size, monitoring multiple logfiles
(intended for extensions that have their own logs), and a control panel that can show the log(s) on target hardware and
mail them to a developer.

All of the other pieces of HJSKit are built using using HJSDebug.
